  <h2 id="chapter-7-circular-motion">Chapter 7 Circular motion</h2>

  <p>Circular motion is the simplest form of a motion along a
  <em>curved trajectory</em>.</p>

  <h3 id="how-the-motion-can-take-turns">How the motion can take
  turns</h3>

  <p>The acceleration changes the velocity, not only the magnitude
  but also the <em>direction</em>. The simplest way to change the
  direction is by applying the acceleration so that it only changes
  the direction, but no magnitude. This is achieved by making the
  acceleration <em>perpendicular to the velocity</em>.</p>

  <p>Remember: instantaneous acceleration can be decomposed as two
  components -- parallel or penpendicular to the velocity. The
  parallel component changes the magnitude of the velocity, the
  perpendicular one changes the direction. <strong>This only
  applies on instantaneous acceleration!</strong></p>

  <h3 id="circular-motion-at-constant-speed">Circular motion at
  constant speed</h3>

  <p>If the trajectory is a circle, this motion is called the
  <em>circular motion</em>. The simplest way is that the speed is
  not changed, that is, the magnitude of the velocity is
  constant.</p>

  <p><strong>Remember</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The speed is not changed, but the direction of motion is
    always changing: they are always along the tangential direction
    of the circle.</li>

    <li>The direction of the acceleration is always
    <em>changing</em>: always pointing to the center. The magnitude
    is constant.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To describe the circular motion, we need to get used to a new
  unit: the <em>radian</em>. We know that for a angle at the center
  of a circle, the arc length that corresponds to this angle is
  proportional to it: $l \propto \theta$. We also know that $l
  \propto r$. So we define the radian unit so that $l=r\theta$. For
  example, a whole angle, $360^\circ$, corresponds to a whole
  circle. So $360^\circ = 2\pi \ \rm rad$.</p>

  <p>Quantities that describe this kind of motion includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Speed $v$.</li>

    <li>Angular speed $\omega$, describing how large the angle it
    can rotate in unit time. We have $\omega r = v$.</li>

    <li>Period $T$, describing the time for a whole circle. We have
    $T = 2\pi / \omega$</li>

    <li>Frequency $f$, describing how many circles can be finished
    in unit time. $f=1/T$.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For this kind of motion, the acceleration is $$ a =
  \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r $$ this acceleration is called the
  <em>centripetal acceleration</em>.</p>

  <h3 id="centripetal-force">Centripetal force</h3>

  <p>To finish the circular motion, we need a force to offer the
  centripetal acceleration. Thus we required a force equals to
  $ma$. This force is called <em>centripetal force</em>, written
  as: $$ F = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m \omega^2 r $$</p>

  <p>This force is not an actual force. Instead, it is a
  <em>requirement</em> to finish the circular motion. It's the
  actual forces: gravity, pushing, pulling, spring, friction
  forces, etc, that offers the centripetal force.</p>

  <h3 id="solutions-to-book2-practice">Solutions to Book2
  Practice</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>C. Unit should be inverse of time.</li>

    <li>B. Worn tyres causes smaller friction, which is probably
    not able to offer enough centripetal force.</li>

    <li>B. Use formula $\omega = \theta/t$, we have $\omega = 2 \pi
    \times 14.5/60\ \rm rad/s = 1.52\ \rm rad/s$.</li>

    <li>C. The string is holding the mass. Notice that the motion
    is in a horizontal circle, so gravity does not participate in
    this motion.</li>

    <li>(a) At first the train is moving along the horizontal
    track. It is a simple acceleration along a straight line. So:
    $$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $$ Force is calculated by: $$
    F = ma = 12000 * \frac{57-0}{3.5} = 195429 \ \rm N $$</li>
  </ol>

  <p>(b)</p>

  <center>
    <img src="./AS-Physics/5B5b.png" width="30%" />
  </center>

  <p>(c) The "radius of curvature" is nothing but the radius of the
  circular motion. X is just the starting point of the circular
  motion. So simply plug in the formulas for that. From $$ F =
  m\frac{v^2}{r} $$ we have $$ r = \frac{mv^2}{F} = \frac{v^2}{3 g}
  = \frac{57^2}{3 \times 9.8} = 110.51 \ \rm m $$</p>

  <p>(d) During the motion, kinetic energy is tranferred into
  gravitational potential energy (because resistance is
  negligible). We can write down: $$ \Delta E_p = - \Delta E_k $$
  Thus $$ mg(h_{\rm top} - h_{\rm bottom}) = mgh = -
  (\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2) = \frac{1}{2}m(57^2 -
  20^2) $$ Solve this equation we can get $h=145 \ \rm m$. We can
  also understand the process by kinetic energy theorem: works
  exerted by external forces on the body changes the kinetic
  energy. Here, the works is done by the gravitational force, which
  is negative work. So: $$ -mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 -
  \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 $$ This equation is the same as the above. (e)
  Point Y is just the top point. Weightless means that there is no
  interaction between the rider and the seat (the "reaction force"
  is $0$). The gravitational force is just enough to offer the
  centripetal force. The speed at Y is just $20$ that we used in
  the above question. So: $$ mg = m\frac{v_2^2}{r_Y} $$ Then we can
  solve the $r_Y = v^2_2/g = 40.8\ \rm m$. 6. (a) "20 revolutions
  per minute". So $\omega = 20 \times 2\pi/60 = 2\pi/3\ \rm rad/s$.
  (b) Acceleration is just $\omega^2 r = g$, thus we can solve for
  $r$. 7. (a) $T = 2\pi r/v = 1474\ \rm s$. (b) $F = mv^2/r =
  10.75\ \rm N$ (c) (i) Simply draw arrows that pointing into the
  center. (ii) Maximum: at the bottom: $F_n - mg = F_c$. Minimum:
  at the top: $mg - F_n = F_c$.</p>

  <h2 id="chapter-8-gravitation">Chapter 8 Gravitation</h2>

  <p>Previously our understanding to gravitation is simply "weight
  is gravitation". This is not the case, however. Weight is not a
  fundamental force. In contrast, it's part of the gravitation
  given by the earth. To understand the gravitation
  comprehensively, we should jump beyond the earth and into the
  universe. This chapter leads you to take a look at the earth from
  a higher point of view.</p>

  <h3 id="gravitational-forces">Gravitational forces</h3>

  <p>Gravitational forces is the interaction between objects due to
  the mass they own. In other words, any objects must have this
  interaction with each other as long as they have non-zero mass
  (we will encounter particles with zero mass in the future). The
  force has the form: $$ F = \frac{GMm}{R^2} $$ where $G = 6.67
  \times 10^{-11}$ is the gravitational constant. $M$ and $m$ are
  the masses of the interacting bodies. $R$ is the radius between
  them. Forces with this form is called "inverse square law": the
  force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.
  The Coulumb's law, which is the interacting forces between
  electric charges, is also a inverse square law. We will dig
  deeper about this kind of forces in the future.</p>

  <p>Usually, we use the symbol $M$ to represent the celestial body
  at the center. For example, a person who stands on the surface of
  the earth will receive a gravitational force $F_G = GMm/R^2$
  where $R$ is the radius of the earth. And, comparing with the
  weight $mg$, we can easily see that $g = GM/R^2$. Similarly, we
  can calculate the force on the surface of other stars, or the
  force from earth when flying in the outerspace.</p>

  <h3 id="gravitational-fields">Gravitational fields</h3>

  <p>This is the first time we encounter the concept of "field".
  The gravitational field is produced by the central celestial
  body, and interacts on the flying body. (<em>Of course,
  inversely, we can also consider the flying body creates a field
  and interacts on the celestial body. But in astronomy and
  cosmology, since the flying body is too light, we never count
  there field. So from now, we are getting used to calculate the
  field from the center celestial body</em>.)</p>

  <p>How to understand that? From the force law $F = GMm/R^2$, we
  can easily see that the force is proportional to the flying body
  for a fixed center star. The coefficient for this fixed star is
  only dependent on the distance. For example, if we are talking
  about the force from the earth to the flying spaceship, then the
  force on the spaceship should obey $F \propto m_{\rm ship}$. The
  proportional coefficient is just $GM/R^2$. This coefficient, if
  we are keep talking about the earth (which means $M$ is not
  changed), is only dependent on $R$.</p>

  <p>We define this coefficient "gravitational field" as: $$ g
  \equiv \frac{GM}{R^2} $$ Gravitational field is a
  <strong>vector</strong>. It always points into the center
  celestial body that creates this field. Note that if we switch to
  talk about another star, like moon, the $M$ changes, and at that
  time we are talking about a new different field produced by the
  moon, $g_{\rm moon} = GM_{\rm moon}/R^2$.</p>

  <p>Why we use the same symbol $g$ for the field and the
  gravitational acceleration? Now you can see that they are the
  same thing! Both of them gives $F_G = mg$. So we say that the
  symbol $g$ represent both the acceleration and the gravitation.
  It has two unit (of course these two units are equivalent):
  $\mathrm{kg \cdot m \cdot s^{-2}} = \mathrm{N/kg}$. You can try
  to prove this.</p>

  <h4 id=
  "what-is-field-jump-this-subsection-if-you-want-but-encourage-to-read">
  What is field? (Jump this subsection if you want, but encourage
  to read)</h4>

  <p>A "field" is defined as something that depends on the
  location. For example, the altitude of the earth surface depends
  on where you are talking about (Of course! The Mount.Zhumulangma
  has the different altitude with the Mariana Trench!). We say that
  the altitude of the surface is a <strong>field function</strong>
  that depends on the location $x$, where $x$ is a vector that can
  pinpoint the location on the earth. Note this function as $A(x)$.
  (You may not be familiar with this symbol for now. But you will
  learn this symbol at the first math class in high school.)</p>

  <p>Another example is the familiar linear function $y = kx + b$.
  We can regard $x$ as the location. Now we say that <strong>$y$ is
  a function of the location $x$</strong>. We can also call $y$ a
  field.</p>

  <p>Now go back to the gravitational field. The field $g = GM/R^2$
  is absolutely a function of location $R$. So we call it a
  field.</p>

  <p>Why we do not call the force $F = GMm/R^2$ a field? The reason
  is it also depends on the flying body $m$. We would like to have
  a look at something that is independent of the body.</p>

  <p>But you may further ask: the gravitational field $g = GM/R^2$
  also depends on the $M$! Why you do not apply the same reason for
  this $M$? Well, this $M$ is from the one who creates the field.
  Without the $M$ we do not have this field. If we change $M$, yes
  you can, but then we are talking another field from another
  celestial body. <strong>For the same celestial body who is
  creating a certain field</strong>, the $M$ is a constant.</p>

  <h3 id="gravitational-potential">Gravitational potential</h3>

  <p>We talked about the gravitational potential energy in terms of
  weights $mg$ before. But this time we are looking at the
  potential energy in the outerspace.</p>

  <p>The definition of the potential energy should be the same:
  it's a kind of energy that is stored in the interactions. The
  interactions tends to release the energy and this energy will be
  transformed into kinetic energy. Previously, the way we define
  the gravitational potential energy is the same as the opposite of
  the works done by the gravity when we push something from the
  0-energy point to the current location.</p>

  <p>For example, we choose a surface to have 0 potential energy.
  Lift a body with mass $m$ to the height $h$. The work done by the
  gravity is negative: $W_G = - mgh$. We say that the potential
  energy is $mgh$. (Remember, the negative work from gravity means
  that the gravity turns other type of energy into gravitational
  potential energy. So we can understand this process as: during
  lifting, gravity does negative work and turns some energy into
  gravitational potential energy. The amount is $mgh$. Then this
  point has the potential energy $mgh$.) We summarize the process
  as:</p>

  <p>$$ E_{pG\text{ at }h} = -W_{G, \text{0 to h}} $$</p>

  <p>Now apply it to the universe. First question: how to define
  the zero-energy point? The answer is: at infinity!</p>

  <p>Now we define infinity to be 0 potential energy. Push the item
  back and we can get the potential energy. The problem is: the
  force is varying during the whole process!</p>

  <p>This calculation needs calculus. You will learn about this
  after you pass AS exam. Now I just show you the result:</p>

  <p>$$ E_{pG} = - \frac{GMm}{R} $$</p>

  <p>This is the gravitational potential energy.</p>

  <p>Now we have another task. For forces, we search for an
  quantity that is independent of $m$ and we call it field. For
  potential energy, shouldn't we do that?</p>

  <p>Yes, we should. The answer, of course, is again the
  coefficient of $m$: $$ V \equiv \frac{E_{pG}}{m} = -\frac{GM}{R}
  $$ We call this quantity <strong>gravitational
  potential</strong>. It only depends on $M$ and $R$.</p>

  <h3 id="gravitational-force-guides-the-space-motion">
  Gravitational force guides the space motion</h3>

  <p>Now we are well-equipped to calculate the phenomena of
  spaceship rotations. The only thing we need to do is: the gravity
  offers the centripedal force. $$ F_G = F_c $$ For example, the
  geostatic satellite is rotating around the earth with the same
  period of earth spin: 24 hours per revolution. What is the height
  from the surface?</p>

  <p>The answer is simple: $$ \frac{GMm}{R^2} = m\omega^2 R = m
  \left(\frac{2\pi}{T} \right)^2 R $$ solve this equation we get:
  $$ R^3 = \frac{GM}{4\pi}T^2 $$ Further, we should notice that
  here the $R$ is the distance from the center of earth to the
  satellite. The distance from the surface to the satellite is $R -
  R_{e}$, where $R_e$ is the earth radius.</p>

  <p>From the above example, we can found that the result does not
  depend on the flying mass $m$. Actually, this is the most case in
  this chapter. Remember, gravity offers the centripedal force,
  gravity offers the acceleration. For any question about flying
  body, write down this equation and you will solve that. No
  exceptions.</p>

  <h3 id="solutions-to-book2-practice-1">Solutions to Book2
  Practice</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>C. Gravitational field and electrostatic field are vector
    fields (at each location in space, there is a vector associate
    with that). The magnitude of forces for both of them obey $F
    \propto r^{-2}$, this is called the inverse square law.</li>

    <li>A. Simply plug in the reasonable numbers.</li>

    <li>C. "Move completely outside the influence of gravitational
    field" means to the infinity. That is, we should change the
    gravitational potential energy from $-GMm/R$ to $0$. Of course,
    we can give it some kinetic energy in addition. This is,
    however, not the "minimal" required by the question. So the
    energy we need is simply $GMm/R = 1.34 \times 10^{12}
    \rm{J}$.</li>

    <li>B. Just the formula $V = -GM/R$.</li>

    <li>Write down the gravitational field for earth and moon: $$
    g_{earth} = \frac{GM_{earth}}{R_{earth}^2}\ g_{moon} =
    \frac{GM_{moon}}{R^2_{moon}} $$ We have $g_{earth} =
    6g_{moon}$, so $$ \frac{M_{earth}}{R_{earth}^2} =
    6\frac{M_{moon}}{R^2_{moon}} $$ with $M_{earth} = 81 M_{moon}$,
    we can get $$ \frac{R_{earth}}{R_{moon}} = \sqrt{\frac{81}{6}}
    = 3.67 $$</li>

    <li>(a) $$ g = \frac{GM}{r} $$ (b) plug in the formula to get
    $g \simeq 9.8$</li>

    <li>(a) 15 complete orbits per 24h, then the angular velocity
    is: $$ \omega = \frac{15 \times 2\pi}{24*3600} = 0.0011 $$ Then
    the acceleration is $$ a = \omega^2 r=7570.37 m/s^2 $$ (b)
    Gravitational force gives acceleration. So $$ \frac{GM}{R^2} =
    a $$ so $$ M = \frac{aR^2}{G} \simeq 6 \times 10^{24} kg
    $$</li>

    <li>(a) The gravity is offering the centripedal force, i.e. the
    gravity is balancing the centrifugal force. If this is small,
    then not enough to offer centripedal force. (b) Still use the
    familiar formula $$ \frac{GM}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R} $$ so $$
    v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $$ So when radius $R$ increase, the speed
    decrease. Similarly, $$ \frac{GM}{R^2} = \omega^2 R =
    \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}R $$ so $$ T = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2R^3}{GM}} $$
    so when radius becomes larger, the period becomes larger. (c)
    Simply plug in the number, result is $T = 5569.35s = 1.55h$ (d)
    Gravitational potential energy goes down. It goes partly into
    the kinetic energy, and partly into the costed energy by the
    resistance.</li>

    <li>(a) Gravitational field is created by the mass of the body
    at the center. It gives force on any massive body that is put
    into this field. $$ g = \frac{GM}{R^2} $$ (b)

  </ol>

  <p>(c) Due to the sun: $$ V_{sun}=-\frac{GM_{sun}}{R_{orbit}} $$
  Due to the earth: $$ V_{earth}=-\frac{GM_{earth}}{R_{earth}} $$
  10. They are both inverse squared force field, they both have
  potential energy and potential, they both has the direction along
  the line between the two objects. But mass is always positive,
  while electric charge can be negative. So gravitational force is
  always attracting, but electric force can be repulsive.</p>

  <h2 id="review-project-1-crazy-alex-yu">Review Project 1: Crazy
  Alex Yu</h2>

  <center>
    <img src="./AS-Physics/figure.png" width="70%" />
  </center>

  <p>Alex Yu wants to go to the tower across the river. There is no
  bridge, no boat, no plane, no any transportation. But she is
  crazily enthusiastic. She must arrive the tower.</p>

  <p>Her teacher, Isaac Wang, is helping her design a crazy
  facility so that this crazy guy and arrive the other side of the
  river.</p>

  <h3 id="part-1-ejection-from-the-spring">Part 1: Ejection from
  the spring</h3>

  <p>She sits in a small chair with wheels, holding on the spring
  by a rod which is attached to an rolling axis. A known force $F$
  is pushing the top of the rod so that Alex is holding at the
  position. The spring is compressed. The platform is smooth. Then
  release the force $F$, she is ejected, and flies out the platform
  at point A.</p>

  <p>Known quantities: force $F$, rod length $l$ and $3l$, spring
  constant $k$, and mass of you and your car $m$.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Initially, Alex is hold at that position. What is the force
    from the spring that makes her in equilibrium?</li>

    <li>How much length is the spring compressed?</li>

    <li>Once she is well prepared, the force $F$ is released, and
    Alex is ejected out. What is the speed of her after she leaves
    the spring?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Solutions</strong> :</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>For Alex, two forces are exerting on her: the spring force
      and the rod force. For the rod, two forces combined to keep
      it in rotation equilibrium: the force from Alex, and the
      external force $F$. Thus we can write down the equation for
      the equilibium of the rod rotation: $$ F_{spring} l=F \cdot
      3l $$ Thus we have $$ F_{spring} = 3F $$</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The spring force is given by the Hooke's law: $F_{spring}
      = k \Delta x$, so we have $$ \Delta x = \frac{3F}{k} $$</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Here, the elastic potential energy stored in the spring is
      transformed into the kinetic energy of Alex. The initial
      elastic potential energy is: $$ E_p = \frac{1}{2}k \Delta x^2
      $$ The final kinetic energy is: $$ E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$
      We have $E_p = E_k$, so the velocity is: $$
      v_A=\frac{3F}{\sqrt{mk}} $$</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="part-2-flying-in-the-sky">Part 2: Flying in the sky</h3>

  <p>After ejected from the platform, she flies in the sky and
  exactly enters the track at point B. (by "exactly", it means that
  the velocity direction is exactly parallel to the direction of
  the track at point B)</p>

  <p>Known quantities: the angle $\theta$, and all the quantities
  solved above.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the initial velocity when she flies out from the
    platform?</li>

    <li>What is the horizontal and vertical velocity at point
    B?</li>

    <li>How much time does she fly from A to B?</li>

    <li>What is the horizontal and vertical distance from A to
    B?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Of course the initial velocity is just the velocity
      $v_A$.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>From A to B, Alex has two motions: in horizontal
      direction, the motion is at a constant velocity. While at
      vertical direction, it's at a constant acceleration $g$ with
      zero initial velocity. So the horizontal velocity at B is
      still equals to that at A: $$v_{Bx}=v_A$$</p>

      <p>We do not know the time so far, so we cannot directly
      calculate the vertical velocity at B. However, we know that
      the direction of the total velocity at B is along $\theta$,
      so</p>

      <p>$$v_{By} = v_{Bx} \tan \theta = v_A \tan \theta$$</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Now we can solve the time: from $$v_{By} = g t$$ we get
      $$t_{AB} = v_{By}/g = \frac{v_A \tan \theta}{g}$$</p>

      <p>With time calculated, we can immediately get the
      displacement: $$ x_{AB} = v_A t_{AB} = \frac{v_A^2 \tan
      \theta}{g} \ y_{AB} = \frac{1}{2} g t_{AB}^2 = \frac{v_A^2
      \tan^2\theta}{2g} $$</p>

  <h3 id="part-3-running-in-the-track">Part 3: Running in the
  track</h3>

  <p>After she enters the track at point B, she runs along the
  track and finally arrives C. No energy lost at point B during she
  enters the track. But remember, this car has no engine.</p>

  <p>The track is smooth, but not straight. No energy lost while
  moving in the track.</p>

  <p>Known quantities: height between B and C $h_{BC}$, and the
  quantities calculated above.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is the kinetic energy at point B?</li>

    <li>What is the change of gravitational potential energy from B
    to C?</li>

    <li>What is the speed at point C?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Kinetic energy is simply: $$ E_k = \frac{1}{2}m v_B^2
    $$</li>

    <li>The gravitational potential gets higher. Since we know that
    $$ h_{BC} = h_C - h_B $$ we know that $$ \Delta E_{p}=E_{pC} -
    E_{pB} = mgh_C - mgh_B = mgh_{BC} $$ This is a positive
    value.</li>

    <li>During this process, energy is conserved: kinetic energy is
    transferred into gravitational potential energy. We can write
    down: $$ \Delta E_k = \frac{1}{2}m(v_C^2 - v_B^2) = -\Delta E_p
    = -mgh_{BC} $$ Solve this equation and we can get $$ v_C =
    \sqrt{v_B^2 - 2gh_{BC}} $$</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="part-4-running-along-the-slope">Part 4: Running along the
  slope</h3>

  <p>After finishing the track, she arrives point C. Now the tower
  is exactly at D. Only a straight way remaining! No energy lost at
  point C. That means, the speed at C when her leave the track BC
  is the speed that she starts moving along CD.</p>

  <p>But this way is not smooth. The friction is $f$. She exactly
  stops at D finally.</p>

  <p>Known quantities: slope of CD $\alpha$, and all the quantities
  calculated above.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How many forces are exerting on her?</li>

    <li>What is her acceleration?</li>

    <li>She finally stops at D. How long is CD? How much time does
    it take?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Gravity, supporting force from the slope, and
      friction.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Decompose the forces along the slope. Friction is down
      along the slope. One componenet of gravity also points down
      along the slope. So the acceleration is given by: $$ f+mg\sin
      \alpha = ma $$ so $$ a = g\sin \theta + \frac{f}{m} $$</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Write down the equation: $$ 0 - v_C^2 = -2 a l_{CD} $$ so
      $$ l_{CD} = \frac{v_C^2}{2(g \sin \theta + f/m)} $$</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Congratulations to Alex Yu. She finally arrives the
  tower! (Although she is crazy...) Let's move on to the next
  journey!</strong></p>
